## Normals
___

> ### [Making Sense of Normals](https://polycount.com/discussion/107196/youre-making-me-hard-making-sense-of-hard-edges-uvs-normal-maps-and-vertex-counts/p1)
An excellent guide on the finer points of normals and how they function both when baking maps, and on their own. Talks about hard edges, UV seams, normal maps, vertex counts, and how they're all linked together.
<!-- -->


> ### [Who Put Waviness in My Normal Map?](https://polycount.com/discussion/81154/understanding-averaged-normals-and-ray-projection-who-put-waviness-in-my-normal-map/p1)
An excellent guide on why normal maps can sometimes look bad around the edges/corners of objects.
<!-- -->


> ### [Skew You Buddy!](https://polycount.com/discussion/147227/skew-you-buddy-making-sense-of-skewed-normal-map-details/p1)
A thread covering why normal map details can sometimes look like they're leaning or 'skewed', and how to fix it.
<!-- -->


> ### [Of Bit Depths, Banding and Normal Maps](https://polycount.com/discussion/148303/of-bit-depths-banding-and-normal-maps/p1)
Wondering why your normal maps have harsh bands in them? This guide can help you. Covers why bit depth is so important when working with normal maps, and how to get higher quality results with your standard 8-bit color range.
<!-- -->


> ### [A Practical Guide on Normal Mapping for Games](https://polycount.com/discussion/146667/a-practical-guide-on-normal-mapping-for-games/p1)
An excellent guide to baking normal maps for games. Goes over common issues, common solutions, and some gotchas.
<!-- -->


> ### [Baking with Face Weighted Normals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpUCsWDycis)
Baking mesh maps when using face weighted normals can be tricky. This guide shows strategies for mitigating the frustration, and achieving clean results when using the weighted normal workflow in tandem with baked mesh maps.

## Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
___

> ### [Physically Based](https://physicallybased.info/)
A database of PBR values for a ton of real-world materials and surfaces. Maintained by Anton Palmqvist.
<!-- -->


## Rendering
___

> ### [Render Hell 2.0](https://simonschreibt.de/gat/renderhell/)
Written by Simon Schreibt. A guide to rendering in game engines, written for artists. Most of this technical knowledge won't apply to your work on a daily basis, but all game art content is governed by these rules - and you should be aware of them.
